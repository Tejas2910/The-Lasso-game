# The-Lasso-game
## *Self Project* | *Computer Programming and Utilisation*
- Designed and created an algorithm of a **keyboard game** of throwing a **lasso** to catch coins using **C++**
- Used **Object-oriented programming** and structures to develop different features in the game like
- **Randomised starting position** of falling coins introducing a certain luck factor inside the game
- Set a **target number of coins** to be caught for both players to reach and compete for
- Introduced a help page explaining key controls and a **2nd player** to compete with on the same keyboard
